# CS224n

Stanford's Introduction to NLP course, led by natural language processing giant Chris Manning (creator of word2vec).The content covers the core knowledge points in the field of NLP, including word vector, RNN, LSTM, Seq2Seq model, machine translation, attention mechanism, Transformer, etc.

The five programming tasks are progressively difficult: word vector, word2vec algorithm, Dependency parsing, machine translation, and fine-tune Transformer.

The final big assignment was training the QA model on Stanford's famous SQuAD dataset, and one student's big assignment even went so far as to publish a top paper.
